===================
System requirements
===================

This requires a "working version" of SML/NJ on a POSIX system. It's
best to use version 110.49 or later. Earlier versions have
incompatibilities, bugs, or both.


=============
Configuration
=============

Modify the parameters at the start of 'build' as appropriate for your
system.

These settings may be determined for you automatically by a fancy
configuration program in a future release.


========
Building
========

All sources may be built by running the 'build' script in this
directory. It does a clean re-build of all source files and stabilizes
all libraries produced. The build script is not appropriate for use
during development. Use the standard SML/NJ CM mechanisms if you are
changing the code and don't want to recompile everything each time.

[There is probably a better way to do this, but I haven't figured one
out yet.]


===================
Using the libraries
===================

After building, include libpq/sources.cm in an SML/NJ project's .cm
file. The libraries are stabilized, so people without write access to
the directory can use them without problems.
